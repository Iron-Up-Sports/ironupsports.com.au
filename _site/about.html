<h2>Backstory</h2>

<p>I made my first rep team at 17 years old at an open trial. Selector was looking for a person to play full back and so I put my hand up for it. I knew nothing about full back but a memory of my favourite full back - Christian Cullen, an All Black goat who played full back. I just mimicked what I remember of his playing style. Support play, cover defence etc. When I trialled, I had no anxiety, nerves, no pressure on me but an excitement to play. I went through 3 rounds of open trial and eventually making the final squad for the Auckland Sea Lions u18s. This was my first time going through a proper preseason under performance specialists and skills coaches.</p>

<p>The preseason boosted my confidence because of the newfound speed, fitness, strength and skills I attained. This new level of confidence got me into rep teams after rep teams and ending up moving to Australia to play rugby league at the Sharks, Cabramatta, Western Suburbs etc.</p>

<p>I knew that proper training and preparation was the key to making new rep teams and so I carried this mentality with me to every team I trained for. I would do extras on my own at the local park. My son would jump in and train with me. So I trained and coached him also. My wife was a social media queen and would post me and my son training on Facebook and Instagram. A year of consistent training and posting on social media got people on her friend list requesting for my services. In 2015, I landed my first 2 athletes and my first service was preseason. Preseason was my first-ever program because of the impact it had on my life. 2 athletes became 10, 15 and Iron Up Sports was officially - a high-performance service for youth athletes. I studied and became a performance specialist coach and a skills coach for rugby league.</p>

<p>The name 'Iron Up Sports' derived from the proverb 27:17 - "As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another." During my sporting journey, my wife's cousin was building a house in Sutherland Shire. I happened to move to a place in Padstow and we were 15 minutes drive away from them. They invited us over to train in their gym and have a meal afterwards. That training session lead to multiple sessions which eventually became our routine session in the afternoons. The guy was a Christian guy who was obsessed with mindset. He was my gym partner/mentor. He spoke about mindset with me for two years. Those two years had a major impact on my life. I went from doubt to belief, from pessimism to optimism and from hopelessness to being hopeful. He was my iron sharpens iron. So now I sharpen youth to make them better in sports and most importantly, in life.</p>

<p>So that is how Iron Up Sports came about to be the service for youth athletes. To help them to be better rugby league players, better athletically and develop better human beings on and off the field.</p>
